# Command Pattern Todo List

This is a simple demo of a React + TypeScript + Vite project that illustrates how to use the _[Command Pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command)_
to implement features such as undo/redo for a simple todo list.

After cloning the project, you can check out the final implementation in the branch `with-command`:

```sh
git checkout with-command
```

# Installation

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can compare the changes from the base project on this [Pull Request](https://github.com/jv-vogler/command-pattern-todolist/pull/1/files).
